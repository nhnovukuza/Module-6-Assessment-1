                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p> Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus oxry. They stand about 1.2 m at the shoulder.
        The body length can vary from 190 to 240cm and the tail measures 45 to 90cm.
    Male gemsbok can weigh between 180-240 kg while females weigh 100-210 kg.
  Gemsbok are widely hunted for their spectacular horns that average 85cm in length. From a distance,
the only outward difference between males and females is their horns, and many hunters mistake
females for males each year. </p>
     
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen N05, right next to the Panda Canyon.</p>
